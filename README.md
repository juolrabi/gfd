# Generalized finite differences (GFD) source code for solving large scale wave equations

This is a repository for a research project that aim to create an efficient numerical solver for large scale wave equations. The solver is based on the methodology called discrete exterior calculus (DEC). We call the outcoming method as generalized finite differences, because the solution method is closely related to finite-difference approaches.

The source code implements a library for the neccessary concepts and algorithms. User interface is still a mess. Sorry for that.

The development of the library has been active and in use since 2012 and is still under construction. There are several existing simulation results generated with this code or with previous versions of it. For more details, see [the projects web page](https://sites.google.com/jyu.fi/gfd).

The code in this repository is free software and licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3.

Author of this project is Jukka Räbinä, who currently works in the 
- Faculty of Information Technology at the University of Jyväskylä.

The project is partially funded by
- Academy of Finland Grants No. 259925 and 260076,
- ERC Advanced Grant No. 320773.
